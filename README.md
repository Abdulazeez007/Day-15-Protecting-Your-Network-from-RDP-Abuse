# Day-15-Protecting-Your-Network-from-RDP-Abuse

One of the most commonly abused protocols in the cybersecurity world is Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). While RDP is an essential tool for many IT professionals and organizations, it also presents significant risks when not properly secured. In this blog, we’ll dive into what RDP is, why it’s used, how attackers abuse it, how to find endpoints with exposed RDP, and how you can protect yourself from RDP-based attacks.

## What is RDP?
RDP, or Remote Desktop Protocol, is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows authorized users to remotely access another machine or server. RDP operates over TCP and uses port 3389 by default. This functionality is incredibly useful for IT administrators and professionals who need to troubleshoot or access systems remotely without physically being present at the endpoint.

By enabling RDP, users can connect to their workstations, access files, and perform administrative tasks no matter where they are located, saving time and providing convenience. However, as with many conveniences in the tech world, this ease of use comes with risks — particularly when attackers exploit the protocol for malicious purposes.

## How Attackers Abuse RDP
One of the most dangerous ways attackers compromise a network is through an exposed RDP service. This means that an RDP service is accessible from the internet, and attackers can attempt to connect to it. Here’s how the abuse generally unfolds:

- **Brute Force Attacks:** Attackers may attempt to brute force the login credentials, trying numerous username-password combinations until they find a valid one.
- **Phishing and Credential Theft:** If an attacker has already obtained valid credentials through a phishing attack or data breach, they can use these stolen credentials to log in via RDP.

Once inside the network, attackers can perform credential dumping to obtain more valid login information from other machines. This allows them to move laterally across the network using RDP and potentially escalate their privileges, bringing them closer to their malicious objectives, such as data exfiltration or ransomware deployment.

## Finding Exposed RDP Services
So, how do you find servers with exposed RDP services to ensure they are protected? There are two useful tools: Shodan and Censys.

- **Shodan:** Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. To find exposed RDP services, simply create an account, log in, and search for `port:3389`. Shodan will display a list of IP addresses with RDP running on the default port. It’s essential to ask, “Should this server have RDP exposed?” If not, consider disabling it or restricting access via a VPN.

- **Censys:** Similar to Shodan, Censys allows you to search for devices with open ports. Simply search for `3389`, and you’ll see a list of endpoints with that port exposed. You can further refine your search to focus specifically on RDP services.

By regularly using these tools, you can proactively identify exposed services and take corrective action to reduce your attack surface.

## How to Protect Yourself from RDP Abuse
Now that you understand how attackers abuse RDP and how to find exposed services, let’s talk about how to protect yourself. Here are five crucial recommendations to secure your RDP environment:

1. **Turn Off RDP When Not in Use:** Often, developers enable RDP on development servers for remote administration but forget to disable it after the development phase. Regularly audit your environment using tools like Shodan and Censys to ensure unnecessary RDP services are turned off.
   
2. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Always enable MFA wherever possible. Even if attackers obtain valid credentials, MFA provides an additional layer of security that can prevent unauthorized access. While MFA isn’t foolproof, it’s a critical defense.

3. **Restrict Access:** Implement firewall rules to limit RDP access to specific IP ranges, or better yet, place RDP services behind a VPN. By restricting access, you significantly reduce the chances of brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts from the internet.

4. **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Ensure that passwords are at least 15 characters long and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It’s also a good idea to use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) tool to generate one-time passwords for administrative tasks.

5. **Disable Default Accounts:** Disable any default local administrator accounts. Instead, create unique administrator accounts with non-standard names. This prevents attackers from easily targeting common admin usernames.

It’s important to note that even these measures won’t fully protect you from credential stuffing attacks, where attackers use leaked credentials from a third-party breach. This is why a layered defense approach is crucial.

## Recap
RDP is a powerful tool for remote work and system administration, but it’s also a common target for attackers. To protect yourself from RDP abuse:

- Turn off RDP when it’s not needed.
- Use MFA to add an extra layer of security.
- Restrict access through VPNs and firewalls.
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Disable default accounts and create unique administrator accounts.

By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of a successful RDP-based attack on your systems.
